# JustPractice

Several projects taken on just to practice programming fundamentals. 

1) Intelligent agent practice: 8-Puzzle solver using the A* algorithm
                               nQueen solver using the Simulated Annealing, and steepest hill climbing algorithm
                               
2) Quantum programming: A primitive program using qubit manipulation to produce a user choice program

3) Jack Compiler: A low level java based programming language. Developed compiler, including an analyzer, tokenizer, and parser.

4) BoardGame: A simple monopoly style board game. Includes card select and draw, and player movement. Mostly text based
